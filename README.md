# React Album Manager

React Album Manager is a simple web application for managing albums. You can fetch and display albums from an API, add new albums, update album names, and delete albums. This project serves as a basic template for building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using React.

## Features

- Fetch and display albums from an API.
- Add new albums with a dummy POST request.
- Update album names with a dummy PUT request.
- Delete albums with a dummy DELETE request.
- Dark-themed user interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) for working on the project.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prathikshetty14/albumlist


2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-album-manager
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`. You can access it in your web browser.

## Usage

- Fetch Albums: The application automatically fetches albums from the JSONPlaceholder API when you load the page.

- Add Album: Enter a new album title in the "New Album Title" input field and click the "Add Album" button to add a new album to the top of the list.

- Update Album: Click the "Edit" button next to an album to edit its title. Click "Save" to save the changes, or "Cancel" to discard them.

- Delete Album: Click the "Delete" button next to an album to remove it from the list.

## Customization

You can customize this project in various ways:

- Modify the API endpoints for real data sources.
- Enhance the user interface and styling to fit your preferences.
- Add additional features and functionality to the album manager.
